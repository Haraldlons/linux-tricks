# Linux Tricks
A collection of useful linux bash aliases and notes for different topics in the world of computer science.

## How to install
By installing, you add my bash aliases to your system. They are quite useful, and probably contain some scripts automating processes you often do manually. You can add them by typing the following in the terminal
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Haraldlons/linux-tricks.git
echo "source ~/linux-tricks/.bash_aliases" >> ~/.bashrc
```
## Try them out
After installation you can try one of the features by typing the following in the terminal
```bash
new_note
```
What happens? Only one way to find out!

## Motivation
I have, as many others, experience my fair share of debugging, often ending up in Stack Overflow.
This includes both pure Linux related issues, like what to do when random errors appair, and other issues related to different programming languages or tools. I have often found myself in a situation trying to solve the same issue several times, frustrated that I managed to solve this problem earlier, but can't remember how I did it. This repo should contain the most common solutions to problems, both for Linux but also alot of other computer science related problems like Git, Python, C++, Sublime, ROS, Vim and Bash-scripting. In short, everything I touch while using the computer, and have I problem, I will try to write down the solution here in an intuitive setup.

## My Bash Aliases
I have over the years added more and more aliases I find useful. Some of them trigger a bash-script making more advanced operations. I ***highly*** recommend adding [them](https://github.com/Haraldlons/linux-tricks/blob/master/.bash_aliases) to your .bashrc.
