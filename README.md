# Linux Tricks
A collection of useful linux notes and tricks for different topics in the world of computer science.

## How to install
There is not really anything to install, but I have made many aliases very useful when using Linux. You can add them by typing the following in the terminal
```
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:Haraldlons/linux-tricks.git
echo "source ~/linux-tricks/.bash_aliases" >> ~/.bashrc
```
## Motivation
I have, as many others, experience my fair share of debugging, often ending up in Stack Overflow.
This includes both pure Linux related issues, like what to do when random errors appair, and other issues related to different programming languages or tools. I have often found myself in a situation trying to solve the same issue several times, frustrated that I managed to solve this problem earlier, but can't remember how I did it. This repo should contain the most common solutions to problems, both for Linux but also alot of other computer science related problems like Git, Python, C++, Sublime, ROS, Vim and Bash-scripting. In short, everything I touch while using the computer, and have I problem, I will try to write down the solution here in an intuitive setup.

## My Bash Aliases
I have over the years added more and more aliases I find useful. Some of them trigger a bash-script making more advanced operations. I ***highly*** recommend adding [them](https://github.com/Haraldlons/linux-tricks/blob/master/.bash_aliases) to your .bashrc.
