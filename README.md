# Linux Tricks
A collection of useful linux notes and tricks for different topics in the world of computer science.

## How to install
There is not really anything to install, but I have made many aliases very useful when using Linux. You can add them by typing the following in the terminal
```
echo "if [ -f ~/linux-tricks/.bash_aliases ]; then
     . ~/linux-tricks/.bash_aliases
fi
" >> ~/.bashrc

```
## Motivation
I have, as many others, experience my fair share of debugging as googling often ending up in Stack Overflow trying to solve my issues.
This includes both pure Linux related issues, like what to do when random errors appair and you must search the web for answers. I have often found myself in a situation trying to solve the same issue several times, frustrated that I managed to solve this problem earlier, but can't remember how I did it. This repo should contain the most common solutions to problems, both for Linux but also alot of other computer science related problems like Git, python, c++, sublime. In short, everything I touch while using the computer, and have I problem, I will try to write down the solution here in a intuitive setup.
